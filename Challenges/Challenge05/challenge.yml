hints:
    - When you use == to compare values in PHP it forces the interpreter to "convert" one of the values such that the comparison will make sense.This makes it easy for programmers because they don’t have to cast to a different type and can simply ask the language to determine what is best.If you used === then PHP would also make sure that the values are of the same type before comparing so “1” =/= True anymore.Beginners to PHP and other type juggling languages may be unaware of this issue or the most secure way of approaching the problem of comparison when types are not specified.Whoo hoo PHP! https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php
