hints:
- "\u201CDebug\u201D functionality is left in production. Debug information can potentially\
  \ reveal sensitive information, such as usernames, plugin names, full paths to config\
  \ files, software versions, etc., and provide ways to interact with the remote system,\
  \ bypassing normal user workflow. In this challenge, you can request debug information,\
  \ using two available commands. One of them lists the current directory and another\
  \ - prints the file on the page."
