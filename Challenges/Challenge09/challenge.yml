hints:
- "When you use == to compare values in PHP it forces the interpreter to \"convert\"\
  \ one of the values such that the comparison will make sense.This makes it easy\
  \ for programmers because they don\u2019t have to cast to a different type and can\
  \ simply ask the language to determine what is best.If you used === then PHP would\
  \ also make sure that the values are of the same type before comparing so \u201C\
  1\u201D =/= True anymore.Beginners to PHP and other type juggling languages may\
  \ be unaware of this issue or the most secure way of approaching the problem of\
  \ comparison when types are not specified.Whoo hoo PHP! https://secure.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php\
