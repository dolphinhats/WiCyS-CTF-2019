hints:
- Username truncation and trimming on save operation. This bug has previously been
  seen in database management systems. When the database saves the username, it truncates
  and trims the username, which causes the override of the previously created user
  if the usernames match.So, you may need to append something to the "admin" user,
  but this time just a whitespace will not work because the program is smarter --
  it trims at a certain number of characters. What if the user is trying to register
  an "admin" that has a lot of whitespaces and then something else?
