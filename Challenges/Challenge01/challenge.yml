hints:
- User input must be sanitized before being used in systems such as a database or
  syscall. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection
- Try inserting something like ;ls
- The programmer prevented reading of the flag file directly from Apache... Try to
  use a command like cat to read it...
- So cat didn't work huh? There are plenty of other commands that you can use to bypass
  this restriction.... try head, tail, or cp
