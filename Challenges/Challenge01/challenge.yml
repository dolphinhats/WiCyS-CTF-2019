hints:
    - User input must be sanitized before being used in systems such as a database or syscall. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection
    - Try inserting something like ;ls
    - The programmer prevented reading of the flag file directly from Apache... Try to use a command like cat to read it...
    - So cat didn't work huh? There are plenty of other commands that you can use to bypass this restriction.... try head, tail, or cp
