hints:
    - GET parametersâ€™ range validation. Not validating user input may cause many security issues. In this case, the user can request more information from the server than the user is allowed to view, using a GET parameter "lines". One of the most striking examples of such vulnerabilities is a heartbleed vulnerability from 2014.
