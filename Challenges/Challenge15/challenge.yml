hints:
- Predictable pseudo-random number generation. Pseudo-random number generation is
  often used in cryptography. If the attacker can predict what seed number was used
  to generate a pseudo-random number, then the attacker can end up with calculating
  the keys necessary to decrypt the data.In this case, your goal is to generate every
  possible outcome based on the password generator (which is about 20 different outcomes)
  and try out every one of them.
