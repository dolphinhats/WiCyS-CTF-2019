hints:
    - Never leave sensitive information in git history. Never commit in your version control any credentials, keys, passwords, etc., because all that information can be retrieved later from the logs of git. There are tools to do this automatically (like https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog and https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob).In this challenge, you need to find a way how to view the git log. Then, figure out how to checkout a specific commit and see what is inside of it.
